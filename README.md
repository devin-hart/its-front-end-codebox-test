# ITS Front End DEV Test

Welcome to the IntuitSolutions front end development test! You'll be given a design that you'll
be asked to replicate in HTML and CSS.

During your test we'll be checking in on you every half hour or so to make sure you're not stuck on anything,
and if you are feel free to ask your interviewer(s). This test is to just get a better understanding of where you're at with HTML
and CSS, so it won't hurt if you have specific questions, and it most likely would hurt if you're stuck on
something small and spend all your time on it and don't finish because of something as trivial as that.
So don't be afraid to ask questions!

Your task, should you choose to accept it, as a potential IntuitSolutions employee:

1. Create a fully-functional, styled HTML document based on the image representation 
   given to you within the time frame allotted (you have roughly 2 hours). This is not a memory
   test and not a test of working in a tough new environment.
 
	- Feel free to Google whatever you're unsure of! We use Google daily, there's no reason you shouldn't be able to as well. 
	- Your code should be as clean and readable as possible
	- Do not use a pre-made grid system or components (e.g. no Bootstrap, Foundation, etc.)
	- Don't worry about making the site responsive

2. If you are able to finish the HTML/CSS on your site with time remaining, feel free to try the
   JavaScript challenge!

	- This part is completely optional, if you don't get to it it won't be any points off or held
	   against you.
	- Feel free to import JQuery if you're more comfortable writing with it.

    ### JavaScript Challenge:

    - Search throws an alert with the content of the input
    - Tabs work: show and hide content
    - Clicking the left side CTAs removes them

3. Once you're finished please let your interviewer(s) know and we'll proceed with the rest of the interview.
